- Imagine the combat bar of Undertale
    - We are gonna have a bar on the bottom of the screen with a hand going left and right through it
- That bar is gonna be filled with "actions", those actions will occupy some space on the bar
    - for ex, if the bar is 10 units, attacking could 6, healing 4
- The one button is gonna stop the moving bar and execute the action that it stops on
- Opponents will have a fixed move pool with timer (aka attack in 2 seconds, defend in 4 etc..) and is CPU
- upon a victory you can choose a new "[Action](../Trijam%20304%20-%201%20button%20adventure/Actions_combat.md)" or an upgrade
    - for ex -2 "healing" action but +2 "heavy attack"
    - choose from 3 options ❓
    - choosing is gonna be "mandatory" ❓
    - possibly include a passive buff
- Before a new fight, two opponents are presented and you can choose who to go against ❓❓
- Goal is to defeat x amount of enemies
    - what the heck is X ❓❓
